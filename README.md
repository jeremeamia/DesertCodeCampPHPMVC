# MVC Architecture in PHP

This is a sample project for a presentation at the April 2011 Desert Code Camp in
Chandler, Arizona. Visit the [Code Camp website](http://apr2011.desertcodecamp.com)
for more details. Also please check out the page for our [MVC Architecture in PHP presentation](http://apr2011.desertcodecamp.com/session/272) 
on the website as well.

## Project

The project is a simple agile programming tool for creating user story cards. To keep this project very small and simple, it will consist of only 1 controller and 1 model for representing the user stories. In order to demonstrate the different parts of our presentation we will have a few separate branches for showing specific features/ideas:

- original - original code based on a typical [Kohana 3.1.2](http://kohanaframework.org) installation
- view-classes - modified code where actions and view are rewritten using the Kostache/Mustache module

## Presentation

### Summary

Using Kohana, a powerful PHP 5 MVC framework, we will discuss how to properly use
